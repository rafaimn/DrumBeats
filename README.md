# DrumBeats

DrumBeats is a web application that allows users to play drum sounds by clicking on keys or typing on their keyboard. The project was built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with a focus on the JavaScript code.

## Usage

To play the sounds, simply click on the keys displayed on the screen or type on your keyboard. Each key represents a different drum sound. You can also input a sequence of letters in the input box and click the "play" button to hear a composition of sounds.

## JavaScript Code

The JavaScript code for this project is located in the `script.js` file. It includes event listeners to handle both keyboard and mouse clicks, and functions to play the appropriate drum sound when a key is pressed or clicked. The `playComposition` function allows for the playing of a sequence of drum sounds.
